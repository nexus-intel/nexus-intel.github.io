# Healthcare Hub: Automated Claims & Super Bills Processing

## The Challenge
A European clinical laboratory network was struggling with a 15% rejection rate on insurance claims due to manual data entry errors from "Super Bills" and Insurance Cards. The billing cycle was averaging 45 days.

## The Solution: Healthcare Workflow Automation
We implemented a HIPAA-compliant (and GDPR-ready) automation suite that handles:
1.  **Insurance Card OCR**: Instant extraction of member IDs, group numbers, and plan types from various European providers.
2.  **Super Bill Digitization**: Mapping CPT codes and ICD-10 codes from handwriting or semi-structured print to the central billing system.
3.  **Real-time Eligibility**: Instant verification of insurance status before the patient leaves the clinic.

## The Result
- **Rejection Rate**: Slashed from 15% to < 2.1%.
- **Billing Cycle**: Reduced from 45 days to 7 days.
- **Efficiency**: Staff saved 40 hours per week on data entry per clinic.

## Technical Stack
- **Extraction**: Document AI (Vertex AI)
- **Verification**: Custom Pydantic AI Validation layers
- **Compliance**: End-to-end encrypted processing pipelines

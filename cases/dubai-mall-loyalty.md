# Retail Revolution: Dubai Mall Loyalty Automation

## The Challenge
One of the world's largest retail destinations required a way to verify physical receipts from thousands of different merchants to instantly credit loyalty points via their mobile app. Manual verification was slow, error-prone, and prevented real-time engagement.

## The Solution: Advanced Document Intelligence
We deployed a custom **Document Workflow Automation** engine that utilizes state-of-the-art vision models to:
1.  **Extract Merchant Data**: Identify the specific store, tax ID, and location from chaotic receipt layouts.
2.  **Verify Transaction**: Cross-reference the date, time, and total amount against mall-wide sales data.
3.  **Fraud Detection**: Detect duplicate submissions and digital alterations using advanced image forensics.

## The Result
- **Automation Rate**: 96% of receipts processed without human intervention.
- **Latency**: Point credit reduced from 24 hours to < 5 seconds.
- **ROI**: Increased customer app engagement by 340% within the first quarter.

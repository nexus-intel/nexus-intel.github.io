# Multimodal Vibes: Intent-Driven Video Analysis with Gemini API

> Orchestrating high-context video intelligence through declarative intent, agentic reasoning, and the Gemini 1.5 Pro ecosystem.

In the era of **Vibe Coding**, the distance between a developer’s intent and a production-ready application has collapsed. We are no longer meticulously hand-crafting OpenCV pipelines or manually sampling frames at 1 FPS to feed into a clip-interrogator. It is 2026, and the "vibe" is clear: we describe the desired outcome, and the model—specifically **Gemini 1.5 Pro**—ingests the raw, high-entropy reality of video to return structured, actionable intelligence.

This isn't just about "video-to-text." It’s about **Intent-Driven Video Analysis**. It’s the ability to ask a system, "Find the moment the tension in the room shifts," or "Detect the exact frame where the safety protocol was bypassed," and receive a Pydantic-validated response.

## 1. The Architecture of a Multimodal Vibe

To build at the speed of thought, we need a stack that respects the developer's intent while maintaining strict type safety. We aren't just sending strings; we are defining the "Shape of the Vibe."

Our stack for this evolution:
*   **Gemini 1.5 Pro:** The heavy lifter with a 2M+ token context window, capable of "watching" hours of video in a single prompt.
*   **Pydantic AI:** The bridge between the LLM's creative output and our application's strict requirements.
*   **LangGraph:** To manage the stateful, iterative reasoning required when a video analysis needs a "double-take."
*   **FastAPI:** The high-performance delivery mechanism.

### The Core Loop
The workflow follows a declarative pattern: **Upload -> Encode Intent -> Agentic Critique -> Structured Output.**

## 2. Technical Deep Dive: Structured Intent with Pydantic AI

Vibe coding is about being declarative. Instead of telling the AI *how* to look at a video, we define *what* we want to find using Pydantic models. This ensures that the "vibe" we capture is immediately usable by downstream services.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from typing import List, Optional

class VisualEvidence(BaseModel):
    timestamp: str = Field(description="The MM:SS where the event occurs")
    description: str = Field(description="Detailed description of the visual cue")
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0, le=1)

class VideoInsight(BaseModel):
    summary: str = Field(description="High-level narrative of the video vibe")
    key_moments: List[VisualEvidence]
    sentiment_shift: Optional[str] = Field(description="Where the energy of the video changes")

# Defining the Agent with a gemini-flash-latest backend
vibe_agent = Agent(
    'google-gla:gemini-flash-latest',
    result_type=VideoInsight,
    system_prompt="You are a cinematic analyst. Extract the narrative arc and specific visual evidence."
)
```

By defining the `result_type`, we eliminate the need for manual parsing. The Gemini API sees this schema and constrains its multimodal reasoning to fit our structure.

## 3. Mastering the Long Context: LangGraph Integration

Video analysis is rarely a one-shot success. Sometimes the agent needs to "zoom in" on a specific segment identified in the first pass. This is where **LangGraph** transforms a simple script into a sophisticated agentic workflow.

We define a graph where the first node performs a "Global Vibe Check" and the second node performs a "Deep Dive" on anomalous timestamps.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from typing import TypedDict

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    video_path: str
    initial_analysis: VideoInsight
    anomalies: List[str]
    final_report: dict

def global_analysis(state: AgentState):
    # Logic to call Gemini API with the full video
    # Returns the structured VideoInsight model
    return {"initial_analysis": vibe_agent.run_sync(state['video_path'])}

def deep_dive_critique(state: AgentState):
    # Logic to ask Gemini to re-examine specific timestamps 
    # identified in the first pass for higher precision
    pass

workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("analyze", global_analysis)
workflow.add_node("critique", deep_dive_critique)
workflow.set_entry_point("analyze")
workflow.add_edge("analyze", "critique")
workflow.add_edge("critique", END)

app = workflow.compile()
```

This graph-based approach allows the developer to orchestrate complex reasoning without getting lost in nested `if/else` logic. You are designing the *flow of intelligence*.

## 4. Deploying the Vibe: FastAPI & Gemini Video Processing

Gemini doesn't just take a file path; it requires the file to be uploaded to the Google AI File API for persistence during the session. Here is how we wrap this into a production-grade FastAPI endpoint.

| Feature | Implementation | Vibe Check |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ingestion** | `genai.upload_file()` | Asynchronous & Scalable |
| **Validation** | Pydantic V2 | Type-safe & Fail-fast |
| **Execution** | Gemini 1.5 Pro | 1M+ Token Context |
| **Output** | JSON-Schema | Ready for Frontend Consumption |

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile
import google.generativeai as genai

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/analyze-vibe")
async def analyze_video(file: UploadFile):
    # 1. Upload to Gemini File API
    video_file = genai.upload_file(path=file.file)
    
    # 2. Wait for processing (Simplified for example)
    # In production, use a polling loop or webhook
    
    # 3. Run the Agentic Graph
    result = app.invoke({"video_path": video_file.uri})
    
    return result
```

## 5. Comparison: Traditional CV vs. Multimodal Vibe Coding

The shift from traditional Computer Vision (CV) to Multimodal LLMs is a paradigm shift in developer productivity.

| Metric | Traditional CV (2020) | Vibe Coding (2026) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Development Time** | Weeks (Training/Fine-tuning) | Minutes (Prompting/Schema) |
| **Contextual Awareness** | Low (Object detection only) | High (Context, Subtext, Intent) |
| **Maintenance** | High (Brittle pipelines) | Low (Natural language updates) |
| **Hardware** | Heavy GPU clusters | Serverless API (Gemini) |

In the "Vibe" era, we trade raw compute-tuning for **semantic orchestration**. We aren't worried about the math of a convolution; we are worried about the clarity of our intent.

## 6. Practical "Vibe Check": Implementing Today

To get this running in your environment, follow these steps:

1.  **Set your Environment:** Obtain a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.
2.  **Define your Schema:** Don't just ask for "data." Define a Pydantic model that represents the business value of the video.
3.  **Use the 1.5 Pro Model:** It is uniquely optimized for video. Its ability to maintain "spatial-temporal" awareness across long durations is unmatched by smaller, open-source multimodal models.
4.  **Token Management:** Remember that video is token-heavy. One minute of video can consume ~60k tokens. Design your agent loops to be mindful of your rate limits while leveraging the massive context window.

## Conclusion: The Future is Declarative

The "Vibe Coding" movement isn't about being lazy; it's about being **effective**. By using Gemini 1.5 Pro as the multimodal engine and frameworks like Pydantic AI and LangGraph as the steering wheel, we transform video from a "black box" of pixels into a structured stream of intelligence.

We are moving toward a world where the software "understands" the video as well as a human analyst does—but at a scale and speed that was previously impossible.
